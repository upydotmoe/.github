<b>Welcome</b>
<br>

We are social community platform for Artists, here making a better place for artists to share their creativity and get more engagement from non-artist, big artists, and other artists.

Feel free to contribute to our project, the API currently is in closed-source, you could send us a message through our twitter ([nor1c_](https://twitter.com/nor1c_)) and we will send you the API detail to get started working with us in this project. Let's make a better place to share creativity.

The API domain will be in https://piv1.upy.moe in the future, we currently can't publish is yet because there's still some work to do until the work stable to use.
